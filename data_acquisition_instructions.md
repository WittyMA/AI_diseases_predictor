## Data Acquisition and Preparation Instructions

This document outlines the steps required to acquire and prepare the datasets for the multi-modal Automated Disease Prediction System. Due to the size and nature of medical datasets, direct download and extensive processing are typically performed outside of this environment. However, the following instructions provide a clear guide.

### 1. Dataset Download

For each disease, download the respective dataset from the provided links. It is recommended to create a dedicated directory structure to organize the raw data.

*   **Diabetes (Pima Indians Diabetes Database):**
    *   Link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/34/diabetes](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/34/diabetes)
    *   Download `diabetes.csv`.

*   **Heart Disease (UCI Machine Learning Repository):**
    *   Link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
    *   Download the relevant heart disease dataset files (e.g., `processed.cleveland.data`). You might need to combine or preprocess these files as per the dataset description.

*   **Chronic Kidney Disease (UCI Machine Learning Repository):**
    *   Link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic+kidney+disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic+kidney+disease)
    *   Download `kidney_disease.csv` or similar.

*   **Liver Disease (Indian Liver Patient Dataset - ILPD):**
    *   Link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset))
    *   Download `ILPD.csv` or similar.

*   **Breast Cancer (Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset):**
    *   Link: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
    *   Download `wdbc.data` or similar.

*   **COVID-19 Symptoms (Kaggle):**
    *   Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takbiralam/covid19-symptoms-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takbiralam/covid19-symptoms-dataset)
    *   Download the CSV file (e.g., `covid19_symptoms.csv`).

*   **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) (Kaggle):**
    *   Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
    *   Download the dataset, which typically contains `train`, `test`, and `val` folders with `NORMAL` and `PNEUMONIA` subfolders.

*   **Chest X-Ray Images (COVID-19) (Kaggle):**
    *   Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)
    *   Download the dataset, which contains `COVID`, `Normal`, and `Viral Pneumonia` images.

### 2. Data Preprocessing (General Guidelines)

After downloading, each dataset will require specific preprocessing steps. The `model_building_code.py` provided previously includes a basic example for tabular data. For image data, refer to the image preprocessing section in Chapter Three.

**Common Preprocessing Steps:**

*   **Handling Missing Values:** Imputation (mean, median, mode, KNN, regression) or deletion.
*   **Feature Encoding:** One-hot encoding for nominal categorical features, label encoding for ordinal categorical features.
*   **Feature Scaling:** Standardization (Z-score normalization) or Min-Max scaling for numerical features.
*   **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identification and handling of anomalous data points.
*   **Data Balancing:** Techniques like SMOTE or undersampling for imbalanced datasets.
*   **Image Specific Preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, noise reduction, segmentation, and augmentation.

It is crucial to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on each dataset to understand its characteristics, identify missing values, outliers, and data distributions before applying preprocessing techniques.

### 3. Directory Structure Recommendation

To keep your project organized, consider a directory structure similar to this:

```
project_root/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   │   ├── diabetes/
│   │   ├── heart_disease/
│   │   ├── kidney_disease/
│   │   ├── liver_disease/
│   │   ├── breast_cancer/
│   │   ├── covid19_symptoms/
│   │   ├── chest_xray_pneumonia/
│   │   └── chest_xray_covid19/
│   └── processed/
│       ├── diabetes_processed.csv
│       ├── heart_disease_processed.csv
│       ├── ...
│       └── chest_xray_pneumonia_processed/
├── notebooks/
│   ├── eda_diabetes.ipynb
│   ├── model_training_heart_disease.ipynb
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── tabular_models.py
│   │   └── image_models.py
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── data_preprocessing.py
│   └── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── chapter_three.md
```

This structured approach will facilitate data management, model development, and collaboration.
